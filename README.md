# Viash project template

This repository is a template for setting up a new
[Viash](https://viash.io) project.

## First development build

After forking it, run the following commands to build your first
development build of the pipeline.

Install Viash and Nextflow:

``` sh
bin/init
```

Build Viash components

``` sh
> bin/viash_build
In development mode with 'dev'.
Exporting combine_columns (demo) =nextflow=> target/nextflow/demo/combine_columns
Exporting remove_comments (demo) =nextflow=> target/nextflow/demo/remove_comments
Exporting take_column (demo) =nextflow=> target/nextflow/demo/take_column
```

Run demo pipeline

``` sh
bin/nextflow run . \
  -main-script workflows/demo_pipeline/main.nf \
  -with-docker \
  --input resources_test/file*.tsv \
  --publishDir temp
```

## Customising the project

Generally, it’s a good idea to edit the `bin/init` by filling the
details of your own repository here. After making changes, rerun the
`bin/init` script.

If you want to start from a clean repository, remove the contents of the
`resources_test/`, `src/`, and `workflows/` directories.

## Unit testing

You can unit test all Viash components using the following command:

``` sh
bin/viash_test
```

## Building a release

The script below assumes you have a separate clone of this repository
specifically for building a release. To do so, switch to the release
branch, merge all changes from the main branch, build all components and
push the new release to Github and the containers to your Docker
registry of choice.

``` sh
# switch to release branch
git checkout release

# allow publishing the target folder
sed -i '/^target$/d' .gitignore

TAG=0.1.0

rm -r target
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main

# build target folder and docker containers
bin/viash_build -m release -t $TAG --max_threads 20

# run unit tests (ideally, these should all pass)
bin/viash_test -m release -t $TAG

# push docker containers to container registry
bin/viash_push -m release -t $TAG --max_threads 20

# commit current code to release branch
git add target
git commit -m "Release $TAG"
git push 

# create new tag
git tag -a "$TAG" -m "Release $TAG"
git push --tags
```

## Running production version

When a release has been made, you can run the pipeline as follows:

``` sh
bin/nextflow run https://github.com/viash-io/viash_project_template \
  -main-script workflows/demo_pipeline/main.nf \
  -r 0.1.0 \
  -resume -latest \
  -with-docker \
  --input resources_test/file*.tsv \
  --publishDir temp
```
